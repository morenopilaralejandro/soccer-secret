## Editing Character Parameters (Development Process)

1. Character parameters are managed using a Google Sheet. ([soccer-secret-0-sheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zS2bfB3gCjEZeVrcTZ_IQVh1Bky9dpiW?usp=sharing)).
2. By modifying attributes such as speed, control, or learnable special moves directly within the sheet, the process of editing and balancing stats becomes much more efficient and manageable than traditional manual data entry.
3. The updated data is then exported as a CSV file. 
4. Within the Unity Editor, the Player Importer tool is used to load and apply these parameters to the game.

## Localization (Development Process)
This project supports both English and Japanese languages. The Japanese character atlas is generated automatically using the Atlas Generator tool. It scans the text content from the project's String Tables and compiles a texture atlas containing only the necessary Japanese characters, optimizing performance and memory usage.
