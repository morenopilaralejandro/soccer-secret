## Editing Character Parameters (Development Process)

1. Character parameters are managed using a Google Sheet. ([soccer-secret-0-sheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zS2bfB3gCjEZeVrcTZ_IQVh1Bky9dpiW?usp=sharing)).
2. By modifying attributes such as speed, control, or learnable special moves directly within the sheet, the process of editing and balancing stats becomes much more efficient and manageable than traditional manual data entry.
3. The updated data is then exported as a CSV file. 
4. Within the Unity Editor, the Player Importer tool is used to load and apply these parameters to the game.

### Editing Character Parameters (Development Process)

During development, character parameters are managed using a shared Google Sheet. 
Attributes (such as speed, control, or special moves that can be learned) are modified directly in the sheet, making it much easier to edit and balance stats compared to manual editing. 
The updated data is then exported as a CSV file. Within the Unity Editor, the Player Importer tool is used to load and apply these parameters to the game.

Attributesâ€”such as speed, control, or special moves that can be learnedâ€”are modified directly in the sheet. This streamlined approach greatly simplifies the process of editing and balancing stats, making it significantly more efficient than manual data entry.
