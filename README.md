## Editing Character Parameters (Development Process)

1. Character parameters are managed using Google Sheets. ([soccer-secret-0-sheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zS2bfB3gCjEZeVrcTZ_IQVh1Bky9dpiW?usp=sharing)).
2. By modifying attributes such as speed, control, or learnable secret moves directly within the sheet, the process of editing and balancing stats becomes much more efficient and manageable than traditional manual data entry.
3. The updated data is then exported as a CSV file. 
4. Within the Unity Editor, the Player Importer tool is used to load and apply these parameters to the game.

## Localization (Development Process)
This project uses the Unity Localization package and currently supports English and Japanese languages. For Japanese support, the Japanese character atlas is generated automatically using the Atlas Generator tool. The tool scans all text content from the project's String Tables and compiles a texture atlas that includes only the necessary Japanese characters. This process helps optimize both performance and memory usage.
